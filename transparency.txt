Whats going on with transparency?

Sorting triangles how they should be rendered requires some algorithm that I wasn't able to figure out. If you know somethign that could help me with that, feel free to contact me.
I also asked about some algorithm on stackoverflow, this is the question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59598819/opengl-render-closed-transparent-objects

So now to continue the development I decided to end working on such an algorithm and start wworking on other subjects. 

What works now?
Triangles that are in one line are rendered without any glitches so windows etc. will work.
